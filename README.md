# BlackJack-Simulator

This is a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack game in Java.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Compile and run the `BlackJack` class to start the game.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - You will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will also have two cards (one face-up and one face-down).

3. **Game Loop:**
   - You have the option to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).
   - The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If your hand value is 21 (Blackjack), you win!
   - If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose.
   - If you choose to "stand," the dealer will reveal their face-down card.
   - The winner is determined based on the total hand values. Ties are considered a "push."

5. **Console Interaction:**
   - The game provides a simple console interface for user input and game updates.
